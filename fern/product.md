# Realtime Collaboration Platform - Product Requirements

## Executive Summary
Building a modern, realtime collaboration platform inspired by Notion that enables teams and individuals to create, organize, and collaborate on content through a flexible block-based editor with database capabilities.

## Problem Statement
Current collaboration tools are either too rigid (traditional docs) or too chaotic (basic note-taking). Teams need a flexible workspace that can adapt to different content types while maintaining real-time collaboration and organization capabilities.

### Core Problems We're Solving:
1. **Context Switching Fatigue** - Users jump between multiple tools (docs, spreadsheets, task managers)
2. **Limited Real-time Collaboration** - Most tools have basic collaboration or poor conflict resolution
3. **Inflexible Content Structure** - Traditional documents don't adapt to different content types
4. **Poor Organization at Scale** - Hard to maintain structure as content grows

## Target Audience

### Primary Personas:
1. **Team Leads & Project Managers** (Ages 28-45)
   - Need structured project documentation
   - Manage multiple stakeholders
   - Pain: Information scattered across tools

2. **Knowledge Workers** (Ages 24-40)
   - Create and consume lots of documentation
   - Need quick access to organized information
   - Pain: Slow document loading and poor search

3. **Small to Medium Teams** (5-50 people)
   - Need collaborative workspace
   - Mix of technical and non-technical users
   - Pain: Tool fragmentation and version control

## Core Value Proposition
"A single, flexible workspace where teams can create, organize, and collaborate on any type of content in real-time, without the complexity of traditional tools or the limitations of basic note-taking apps."

## User Stories

### Must Have (Core MVP)
**Epic 1: Content Creation & Editing**

- As a user, I want to see real-time changes from collaborators, so that we can work together seamlessly
- As a user, I want to add different block types (text, headings, lists, images), so that I can create rich content

**Epic 2: Organization & Navigation**
- As a user, I want to organize pages in a hierarchical sidebar, so that I can find content quickly
- As a user, I want to search across all content, so that I can locate information instantly

**Epic 3: Collaboration & Sharing**
- As a user, I want to invite team members to workspaces, so that we can collaborate
- As a user, I want to see who's currently editing, so that I avoid conflicts
- As a user, I want to share pages publicly, so that I can publish content
